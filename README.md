# SisterCheck Inventory API

This backend service was developed as part of the **SisterCheck** project during the [Hackathon Name or Event, e.g. "2025 HealthTech Innovation Hackathon"].  
It provides a lightweight **FastAPI + MongoDB** backend for managing hospital inventory data and checking treatment item availability across facilities.

## üí° Overview

The **Inventory API** enables healthcare facilities to:
- Upload resource inventory data directly from Excel sheets.
- Query their available medical resources by facility.
- Check whether a treatment can be supported based on required items.

This module was designed and implemented as the **inventory and data integration component** of the SisterCheck system.
